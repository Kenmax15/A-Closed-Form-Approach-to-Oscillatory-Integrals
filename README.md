# Closed-Form-Approach-to-Oscillatory-Integrals
This repository aims at presenting a Mathematica program for analytically calculating every term of multi-dimensional integral with highly oscillating kernel. It comes at support to our recent paper of the same name as the repository's title.

## 📁 Contents

- `Notebook.nb` – Main Mathematica notebook.
- `Functions.wl` – custom functions.
- `Figures/` – Generated figures or plots.

## 🚀 How to Use?

1. Open a Mathematica `Notebook.nb` on your computer or go to [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and create an account.
2. Evaluate the cells step by step or run the whole notebook using `Evaluation → Evaluate Notebook`.
